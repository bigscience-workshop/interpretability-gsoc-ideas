We want to inform you of how we would like to see the development of your applications.


## Get familiar with what we propose:

- Go through our Ideas pages and learn what we're interested in
- Find the papers and code examples regarding the idea that you found interesting
- Check out the idea discussion in slack


## Understand how could you contribute:


### Pick a proposed Idea

- If you clearly see now what the Idea is about, try to get the related components up and running
- If you feel like you need clarifications, mention an idea mentor in Slack and ask for help
- Mentors will assume that you either are familiar with the related HF components or need help in picking the proper tutorials/papers to study. Mentors will give you advice on how to proceed.


### Your Idea

If you've come with a new idea, that's brilliant!

- Ensure that your idea is not already mentioned on the Ideas page
- Learn which Ideas are relevant for your Idea
- If you're sure that your Idea is not a duplicate of an existing one, feel free to raise an Issue and describe your Idea
- Remember to mention all the relevant existing Ideas, if any exist


## Writing your GSOC application

1. Learn More About Ideas and Issues: read all the BigScience Ideas
2. Learn More about BigScience and HuggingFace: learn core features and give them a try.
3. Prepare Proposal Draft. When working on your proposal, consider having a plan for each week (or two weeks) of the summer.**Use the Proposal Template!**.
4. Get In Contact ASAP
5. Once you have a vision of what your proposal could be, let the mentor know about it.
6. Pay attention to Coding Challenges. You do not need to accomplish a coding challenge to get accepted, but coding challenges are probs the best way to get in touch with mentors.

**Formally, the only things you \*need\* to do are:**

1. find an idea
2. write a proposal
3. submit a proposal
